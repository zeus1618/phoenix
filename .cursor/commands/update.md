description: Update documentation, progress tracker, and README (optionally create detailed learning guide)
---

Follow **Rule 6 (Update)** from `.cursor/rules/dsa-workflow.mdc`.

Update all documentation for the current problem and sync progress across files.

**Note:** If the user requests "create detailed learning" or the problem warrants comprehensive analysis (multiple approaches, counter-intuitive performance, theory vs practice gaps), create a detailed learning file in `<category>/learnings/` folder.
