# DSA Problem-Solving Workflow Rules

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE #0: NEVER MODIFY USER'S SOLUTION CODE

**BEFORE ANY ACTION, CHECK THIS RULE FIRST:**

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:**
- NEVER modify, edit, refactor, or change the user's solution method/function
- NEVER touch the logic/algorithm code written by the user
- NEVER change formatting, spacing, or style in solution methods
- NEVER "improve" or "optimize" the user's solution code
- NEVER fix bugs in solution code unless explicitly asked

**ONLY modify solution code when:**
- User explicitly says: "fix my solution", "change my code", "update my implementation"
- User asks for debugging help on their solution
- User requests refactoring or optimization

**What you CAN modify without asking:**
- Main function and test cases (setup code)
- Documentation and comments
- Progress tracker files
- README and non-solution files

**When in doubt:** Ask the user before touching any solution method.

## Rule 1: Problem Implementation from Links

When a user shares a link to a DSA problem (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.):

**DO:**
- Fetch and read the problem description from the link
- Create a comprehensive `main` function with multiple test cases covering:
  - All examples from the problem
  - Edge cases (empty input, single element, minimum/maximum constraints)
  - Normal cases
  - Boundary cases
- Add detailed JavaDoc documentation including:
  - Problem number and title
  - Problem description
  - Constraints
  - Approach explanation
  - Time and space complexity

**DO NOT:**
- Never create the solution class or solution method
- Never implement the actual algorithm/logic
- The user will implement the solution themselves

## Rule 2: Progress Tracking Updates

When the user asks to "summarize" or "update progress tracker":

1. Check the PROGRESS.md file for the last update date
2. Search for all problem files implemented since that date
3. Update PROGRESS.md with:
   - New problems added to Daily Progress Log
   - New row in Problems Overview Table
   - Their approaches
   - Complexity analysis
   - Whether AI assistance was used
   - Update Summary Statistics (total problems, categories, streak)

## Rule 3: Auto-Update on Problem Transition

When the user says phrases like:
- "move to next problem"
- "next question"
- "going to solve [problem name]"
- Shares a new problem link after completing one

**Automatically:**
1. Update PROGRESS.md with the completed problem details:
   - Add new row to Problems Overview Table
   - Add detailed entry in Daily Progress Log
   - Update Summary Statistics
2. Include: date, time, problem name, link, approach, complexity
3. Mark AI assistance status (based on conversation context)

## Progress Tracker Format

### Problems Overview Table Format
Each row should include:
- Sequential number
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Problem name with link and number
- Difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Category
- Time complexity (Big O notation)
- Space complexity (Big O notation)
- AI Help (✅ Yes / ❌ No) - **Only mark Yes if AI helped with solution/algorithm logic**
- Status (✅ Done / 🔄 In Progress)

### Daily Progress Log Format
Each entry should include:
- Date and time
- Problem name and number
- Problem link
- Brief approach (1-2 sentences)
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- AI assistance: [Yes/No] with specific details

### AI Assistance Definition
**AI assistance = ✅ Yes** ONLY when:
- AI helped write the solution class/method
- AI provided the algorithm logic or approach
- AI debugged or fixed the solution code

**AI assistance = ❌ No** when:
- AI only created main function and test cases (this is expected)
- AI only added documentation/comments
- User implemented the entire solution independently

### Summary Statistics to Update
- Total Problems Solved count
- Categories Covered list
- Current Streak
