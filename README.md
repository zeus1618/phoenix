# 🚀 Phoenix - DSA Learning Journey

A structured approach to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms through consistent practice and documentation.

---

## 📖 About

This repository tracks my journey learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each problem is implemented in Java with comprehensive test cases, documentation, and complexity analysis. The focus is on understanding problem-solving patterns and building strong fundamentals.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Solve problems across all major DSA categories
- ✅ Understand time and space complexity tradeoffs
- ✅ Identify and master common problem-solving patterns
- ✅ Build a reference library of solutions
- ✅ Maintain daily practice consistency

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. **Problem Selection**
- Choose a problem from LeetCode or other platforms
- Share the problem link

### 2. **Setup (Automated via AI)**
- AI reads the problem description
- Creates file with:
  - Comprehensive JavaDoc documentation
  - Main function with test cases
  - Empty solution method for implementation

### 3. **Implementation**
- Implement the solution independently
- Focus on understanding the approach
- Optimize for time and space complexity

### 4. **Testing**
- Run the provided test cases
- Verify edge cases
- Validate against problem constraints

### 5. **Progress Tracking (Automated)**
- Progress tracker updates automatically when moving to next problem
- Includes: problem details, approach, complexity, AI assistance status

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Terminal/Command Prompt

### Running a Solution

1. **Compile the Java file:**
   ```bash
   javac arraysAndHashing/ContainsDuplicate.java
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java arraysAndHashing.ContainsDuplicate
   ```

3. **View test results:**
   - Each test case displays input, output, expected result, and pass/fail status

### Example Output
```
Test Case 1:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 1]
Output: true
Expected: true
Status: PASS ✓
```

## 🤖 Automated Workflow

This project uses Cursor AI rules (`.cursor/rules/dsa-workflow.mdc`) for automated workflows with command-based execution:

### Available Commands

#### `/start <problem_link>`
Generates boilerplate code for a new problem:
- ✅ Fetches problem description
- ✅ Creates main function with comprehensive test cases
- ✅ Adds detailed JavaDoc documentation
- ❌ Does NOT create solution (you implement it)

#### `/analyse`
Analyzes your implemented solution:
- Evaluates time and space complexity
- Identifies strengths and weaknesses
- Suggests alternative approaches
- Compares with optimal solutions

#### `/compare <alternative_solution>`
Compares two solutions in detail:
- Performance analysis (runtime comparison)
- Complexity breakdown
- Constant factor analysis
- Best practices and trade-offs

#### `/summarise`
Consolidates all learnings from current problem:
- Problem evolution journey
- Key insights and takeaways
- Pattern recognition
- Performance lessons

#### `/current`
Shows detailed status overview:
- Current problem progress
- Overall statistics
- Session summary
- Suggested next steps

#### `/update [--detailed-learning]`
Updates all documentation:
- Syncs problem file JavaDoc
- Updates PROGRESS.md
- Updates README.md statistics
- Optional: Creates detailed learning guide for complex problems

#### `/gitpush`
Commits and pushes all changes:
- Generates descriptive commit message
- Commits all tracked changes
- Pushes to remote repository

## 🎓 Learning Approach

### Focus Areas
1. **Understanding over Memorization** - Focus on the "why" behind each solution
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Identify common problem-solving patterns
3. **Complexity Analysis** - Always analyze time and space tradeoffs
4. **Independent Implementation** - Implement solutions without looking at answers

### AI Assistance Policy
- ✅ **AI helps with:** Test case creation, documentation, setup
- ❌ **AI does NOT help with:** Solution logic and algorithm implementation
- 📊 **Tracking:** Progress tracker marks if AI helped with solution

This ensures honest tracking of independently solved problems.
